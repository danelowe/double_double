[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/crftr/double_double/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/crftr/double_double)

A double-entry accrual accounting system for your application. Currency-agnostic but uses the Money gem. Account holder support and contexts are built-in.

## Installation

### Gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'double_double'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install double_double

### Database structure

Create the expected database structure.  If using Rails, generate a migration:

    $ rails generate migration CreateDoubleDouble

Edit the migration to match:

```ruby
class CreateDoubleDouble < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :double_double_accounts do |t|
      t.integer :number,        null: false
      t.string  :name,          null: false
      t.string  :type,          null: false
      t.boolean :contra,        default: false
    end
    add_index :double_double_accounts, [:name, :type]

    create_table :double_double_entries do |t|
      t.string :description
      t.references :initiator,        polymorphic: true
      t.references :entry_type
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_index :double_double_entries, :initiator_id
    add_index :double_double_entries, :initiator_type
    add_index :double_double_entries, :entry_type_id

    create_table :double_double_entry_types do |t|
      t.string :description,    null: false
    end
    add_index :double_double_entry_types, :description

    create_table :double_double_amounts do |t|
      t.string :type
      t.references :account
      t.references :entry
      t.references :context,    polymorphic: true
      t.references :subcontext, polymorphic: true
      t.references :accountee,  polymorphic: true
      
      t.integer :amount_cents, limit: 8, default: 0, null: false
      t.string  :currency
    end
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :context_id
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :context_type
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :subcontext_id
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :subcontext_type
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :accountee_id
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :accountee_type
    add_index :double_double_amounts, :type
    add_index :double_double_amounts, [:account_id, :entry_id]
    add_index :double_double_amounts, [:entry_id, :account_id]
  end
end
```

Rake the new migration

    $ rake db:migrate

## Overview

[Double-entry accounting][1] practices have been [traced back to the 13th century][2].  double_double strives to make accepted practices accessible and relatively easy to implement within other applications.

[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system
[2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system#History

As with many off-the-shelf accounting systems, this project supports:
* **Accountee**: an account holder.
* **Context**: to track activity on invoices, purchase orders, jobs, campaigns, etc.
* **Initiator**: *who* authorized or performed the action.

### Accounts

All accounts created in a double-entry system make up the [chart of accounts][3].  This collection of accounts will determine how money is tracked as it moves through the system.  It is important to design and create the chart of accounts prior to creating entries.  *If we want people to hold "an individual account" in this system, we will configure them as an accountee, not with a new account.  __See the section on accountees__ *

[3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts

In double_double, all accounts created are considered to be the chart of accounts.  All accounts are "on the books."

**Account Class**         | **Normal Balance** | **Description**                                    | **Example Uses**
------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------
`DoubleDouble::Asset`     | Debit              | Resources owned or controlled                      | Cash, Office Computers, Grandma's Jewelry
`DoubleDouble::Liability` | Credit             | Obligations                                        | Accounts Payable, Bank Loan
`DoubleDouble::Equity`    | Credit             | The claim to assets after all liabilities are paid | Paid-In Capital, Dividends, Retained Earnings
`DoubleDouble::Revenue`   | Credit             | Income                                             | Sales, Interest Earned
`DoubleDouble::Expense`   | Debit              | Expenditures                                       | Utilities, Salaries, Rent, Taco Tuesday

Accounts have the following attributes:

* **name**
* **number**, for reporting purposes
* **contra** flag, _optional_ `default: false`

An example 'Cash' asset account as account number `20`

```ruby
DoubleDouble::Asset.create! name: 'Cash', number: 20
```

An example 'Sales' revenue account and a 'Discounts' contra revenue account.

```ruby
DoubleDouble::Revenue.create! name: 'Sales',     number: 40
DoubleDouble::Revenue.create! name: 'Discounts', number: 50, contra: true
```

Contra accounts are used to offset a related account of the same class.  *The example above is a common method to track sales.  The full __sales value__ of the sale would be assigned to 'Sales' while any discounts given would be assigned to 'Discounts.'*


### Example Scenario: Track loan payments back to Grandpa.  

We've decided to keep things very simple and only create a few accounts:
* 'Cash' an asset account.
* 'Grandpa Loan' a liability account.
* 'Spending' an expense account

```ruby
DoubleDouble::Asset.create! name:'Cash', number: 11
DoubleDouble::Liability.create! name:'Grandpa Loan', number: 12
DoubleDouble::Expense.create! name:'Spending', number: 13
```
Grandpa was kind enough to loan us $800 USD in cash for college textbooks.  To enter this we will require a entry which will affect both 'Cash' and 'Grandpa Loan'
```ruby
DoubleDouble::Entry.create!(
  description: 
    'We received a loan from Grandpa',
  debits:[
    {account: 'Cash', amount: '$800'}],
  credits:[
    {account: 'Grandpa Loan', amount: '$800'}])
```
We buy our college textbooks.

```ruby
DoubleDouble::Entry.create!(
  description: 
    'Purchase textbooks from bookstore',
  debits:[
    {account: 'Spending', amount: '$480'}],
  credits:[
    {account: 'Cash', amount: '$480'}])
```
How much cash is left?

```ruby
DoubleDouble::Account.named('Cash').balance.to_s           # => "320.00"
```
We deceided that we wanted to return $320 of the loan.
```ruby
DoubleDouble::Entry.create!(
  description: 
    'Payed back $320 to Grandpa',
  debits:[
    {account: 'Grandpa Loan', amount: '$320'}],
  credits:[
    {account: 'Cash', amount: '$320'}])
```
How much do we still owe Grandpa?
```ruby
DoubleDouble::Account.named('Grandpa Loan').balance.to_s   # => "480.00"
```
How much did we spend?
```ruby
DoubleDouble::Account.named('Spending').balance.to_s       # => "480.00"
```
How much cash do we have left?
```ruby
DoubleDouble::Account.named('Cash').balance.to_s           # => "0.00"
```

## Multiple Currencies in an Account
By default, an exception will be raised if a balance is calculated where there is more that one currency in the amounts.
Allowing a balance to be calculated across different currencies is probably a bad idea, but it can be enabled. 

```ruby
DoubleDouble.configure do |config|
    config.allow_currency_conversion = true
end
```

**Note:** This can allow very unpredictable results, and a lot of rounding errors. 

## Tests

All code is backed by Rspec tests.  Clone this repository and either `rspec spec` or `rake spec` if Rake is installed.
